          Ammit the Truth is a deduction/detective based visual novel style
          video game, using art styles influenced by games like 'Hades', and
          gameplay reminiscent of games like 'Papers Please'. It sees the player
          take the role of Anubis, the guardian of the egyptian afterlife, where
          he must interrogate each soul to determine if they deserve entrance to
          the field of reeds or to be devoured by Ammit.

          For this project, I was the Project Manager.<p></p> I also wrote the
          dialogue for most interactions,
          <p></p>created some 3D models,<p></p> and designed some of the game's
          systems.

          Our team had some incredible talent, especially in the art department,
          and that greatly contributed to (what I believe) is a fantastic set of
          assets. I did 3D art, programming and game design, but my greatest
          contributions were with project management, writing of dialogue and
          planning. Creating this game was not without it's hiccups. I had to
          spend a lot of time managing some of our teammates (along with the 2D
          artist ). Due to this, much of the game was finished the day before it
          was due to be handed in, placing us under a lot of stress.

          Despite these hiccups, the resulting game was rather enjoyable to play
          through, with some beautiful art to look at while doing so. I learnt
          some valuable lessons about how to manage unmotivated teammates and do
          project management. I am more experienced now with creating 3D models
          with optimised topology and in game design philosophy and principles.{" "}
